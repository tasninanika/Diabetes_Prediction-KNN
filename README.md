## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not. The model is trained on real medical data such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age.  
KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their similarity to other points (neighbors).

## ðŸ§  How KNN Works

KNN works by:
1. Choosing a number `K`.
2. Measuring distance between the new data point and all training points.
3. Picking the K closest neighbors.
4. Making a prediction based on the majority class of those neighbors.
